# grunt-htmlclean

Simple and lightweight cleaner for HTML that just removes unneeded whitespaces, line-breaks, comments, etc.  
This plugin is wrapper of [htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean).

[HtmlCompressor](http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/), [HTMLMinifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier) and others are better choice if you want to control details of editing.  
Those configuring are a little pain in the neck for me. And the results was not what I need. So, I wrote htmlclean. This removes unneeded whitespaces, line-breaks, comments, etc. That's all.

## Removing
htmlclean removes the following texts.

+ The leading whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks, and the trailing whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks.
+ The tabs and line-breaks (not whitespaces) between HTML tags.
+ The more than two whitespaces, tabs and line-breaks (suppressed to one space).
+ HTML comments.

## Protecting
The following texts are protected (excluded from removing).

+ The texts in `textarea`, `script` and `style` elements, and text nodes in `pre` elements.
+ The quoted texts in tag attribute.
+ Apache SSI tags.
+ IE conditional comments. e.g. `<!--[if lt IE 7]>`
+ The texts between `<!--[htmlclean-protect]-->` and `<!--[/htmlclean-protect]-->`.
+ The texts that is matched by `protect` option (see "Options").

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-htmlclean --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-htmlclean');
```

## The "htmlclean" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `htmlclean` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  htmlclean: {
    options: {
      protect: /<\!--%fooTemplate\b.*?%-->/g,
      edit: function(html) { return html.replace(/\begg(s?)\b/ig, 'omelet$1'); }
    },
    deploy: {
      expand: true,
      cwd: 'develop/',
      src: '**/*.html',
      dest: 'public_html/'
    },
  },
})
```

See [htmlclean](https://github.com/anseki/htmlclean) for options and more informations.

## Working with grunt-task-helper
For example, you want to clean only changed HTML files. Then [grunt-task-helper](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-task-helper) helps it. In this case, using `handlerByContent` Function instead of this plugin is better. Because grunt parses `files` components in every tasks(targets). `handlerByContent` can be included to one task with other handlers (e.g. select changed HTML files).  
See [grunt-task-helper](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-task-helper).

Example:

`Gruntfile.js`

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  taskHelper: {
    deploy: {
      options: {
        // Select files which are newer than `dest`.
        handlerByFile: 'newFile',
        // Clean the selected files.
        handlerByContent: require('htmlclean')
      },
      expand: true,
      cwd: 'develop/',
      src: '**/*.html',
      dest: 'public_html/'
    }
  }
});
```
